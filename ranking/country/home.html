    1 vs 1 or 2 vs 2,
    pro or open level,
    15+ or no age restriction,
    no female-only battles, and
    only battles won by a dancer who is from the country where it's organised.
    The points per country is the sum of the points acquired by the dancers representing each country.
    The ranking is updated daily.
