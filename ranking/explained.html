<h1>How rankings are calculated</h1>

<div>
  <p>
    The model for the calculation of the Dancehall Battle Ranking (DBR)
    was developed over multiple months in the last part of 2019
    during which time different algorithms were tested and discussed.
    The main goal was to create an algorithm
    that allows to rank different dancers and countries
    across different events at different times at different locations.
  </p>

  <p>
    In what follows we will explain six different types of rankings.
    Three for dancers and three for countries:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Dancer</li>
    <li>Dancer (1 vs 1)</li>
    <li>Dancer (2 vs 2)</li>
    <li>Country</li>
    <li>Country (home)</li>
    <li>Country (away)</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div>
  <h2>Dancer rankings</h2>

  <p>
    The dancer rankings awards points to every dancer that participated in a battle in the last 12 months.
    Their points are calculated based on the number of battles they have won,
    together with how long ago the battle took place.
  </p>

  <div>
    <h3>Difference between rankings</h3>

    <p>
      There are three rankings for individual dancers:
      dancer, dancer (1 vs 1), and dancer (2 vs 2).
      The dancer ranking takes into account both 1 vs 1 and 2 vs 2 battles.
      The dancer (1 vs 1) ranking takes only into account 1 vs 1 battles.
      The dancer (2 vs 2) ranking takes only into account 2 vs 2 battles.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <h3>Calculate rankings</h3>

    <p>
      A dancer get points for every win in the past 12 months.
      Wins that happened more than 12 months ago are not taking into account.
      The points earned are lowered the longer the win has been.
      For example, a dancer gets less points for a win from 6 months ago then
      for a win from 2 months ago.
      The points currently used can be found in the following table:
    </p>

    <table id="points">
      <tr>
        <th># months ago</th>
        <th >Points</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>18</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>17</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>2</td>
        <td>16</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>13</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>4</td>
        <td>12</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>11</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>8</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>7</td>
        <td>7</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>6</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>9</td>
        <td>3</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>10</td>
        <td>2</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>11</td>
        <td>1</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>\(\geq\) 12</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      The formula to calculate the total points \(points_d\)
      for a dancer \(d\)
      given a set of battles \(B\)
      won by \(d\) is

      $$points_d = \sum_{i=0}^{|B|} \text{pointsOfBattle}(B_i)$$

      where

      $$\text{pointsOfBattle}(b) = lookUp(\text{diff}(b_{date}, today))$$
      $$\text{lookUp}(months) =  \text{look up the points in the above table based on the months}$$
      $$\text{diff}(date1, date2) =  \text{calculate the difference in months between 2 dates}$$
    </p>

    <p>
      Let us use these formulas with an example.
      Assume that today is 2019-12-15 and
      a certain dancers won the following three 1 vs 1 battles:
    </p>

    <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Battle A, \(battle_a\), which took place on 2019-06-24.</li>
      <li>Battle B, \(battle_b\), which took place on 2019-11-12.</li>
      <li>Battle C, \(battle_c\), which took place on 2019-12-01.</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
      The total points for this dancer are the sum of \(\text{pointsOfBattle}(battle_a)\),
      \(\text{pointsOfBattle}(battle_b)\), and
      \(\text{pointsOfBattle}(battle_c)\).
      The points for Battle A calculated as follows:

      $$ \begin{align} \text{pointsOfBattle}(battle_a) & = \text{diff}({battle}_{a,date}, today) \\
      & = \text{diff}(\text{2019-06-24}, \text{2019-12-15}) \\
      & = \text{lookUp}(4) \\
      & = 12 \end{align} $$

      Thus, winning Battle A results into 12 points for dancer \(d\).
      The same can be done for Battle B and Battle C:

      $$ \begin{align} \text{pointsOfBattle}(battle_b) & = diff({battle}_{b,date}, today) \\
      & = \text{diff}(\text{2019-11-12}, \text{2019-12-15}) \\
      & = \text{lookUp}(1) \\
      & = 17 \end{align} $$

      $$ \begin{align} \text{pointsOfBattle}(battle_c) & = diff({battle}_{c,date}, today) \\
      & = \text{diff}(\text{2019-12-01}, \text{2019-12-15}) \\
      & = \text{lookUp}(0) \\
      & = 18 \end{align} $$

      <p>
        This results in 17 points for winning Battle B and 18 points for winning Battle C.
        The total amount of points for dancer \(d\) is the sum of 12, 17, and 18,
        resulting in 47 points.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        The aforementioned battles are 1 vs 1 battles.
        In case it are 2 vs 2 battles, then the points are divided in half:
        half of the points for each of the two dancers that won the battle.
        In our example, the points are then 6, 8.5, and 9, resulting in 23.5 points total
        for one dancer.
