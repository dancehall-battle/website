### How wins are counted in 2 vs 2 battles
One win in a 2 vs 2 battle results in a win awarded to each dancer and country.
For example, if we have a team of a Greek and Spanish dancer,
then Greece and Spain have both one win.
If we have a team of two Greek dancers,
then Greece has two wins.

### What events are used
Certain events and battles might not be used during our analysis,
either because we did not know the event took place or
because we do not have all required information
such as the date the event took place, 
the winner of the battle, or
the country of the event or winner.
